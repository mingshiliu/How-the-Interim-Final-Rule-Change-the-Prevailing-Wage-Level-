How the Interim Final Rule Change the Prevailing Wage Level?

On October 6, 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued an Interim Final Rule (IFR) that  increases required wages for permanent labor certifications and labor condition applications, which are required for H-1B, E-3, and H-1B1 workers for Level I to IV from 17th-34th-50th-67th to 45th-62nd-78th-95th percentiles.

Check out the dashboard using the filter by your occupation tile/soc code, country name and updated dated to compare the change before and after the interim final rule with the following link to Tableau Public:
